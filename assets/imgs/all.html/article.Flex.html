        <h3>Our delicious honey</h3>
        <p>
          Honey is a sweet and viscous substance made by several species of
          bees, the best-known of which are honey bees.Honey is made and stored
          to nourish bee colonies. Bees produce honey by gathering and then
          refining the sugary secretions of plants (primarily floral nectar) or
          the secretions of other insects, like the honeydew of aphids. This
          refinement takes place both within individual bees, through
          regurgitation and enzymatic activity, and during storage in the hive,
          through water evaporation that concentrates the honey's sugars until
          it is thick and viscous.
